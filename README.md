# giab_data_indexes
This repository contains data indexes from NIST's Genome in a Bottle project. The indexes for sequences and alignments are also under:  ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data_indexes/ .

<br />
1. If you want to use raw sequencing data (fastq, fasta, hdf5, xsq etc) for your analysis, then you can use the sequence.index.* files when you need to download our data.

<br />
2. If you want to use pre-aligned data (bam etc) for your analysis, then you can use the alignment.index.* files when you need to download our data.
